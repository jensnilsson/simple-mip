# Simple MIP
The site http://www.simplemip.com/

Optimization solver written in Python using Gomory mixed integer cut algorithm.

Solver gives step by step instructions on how it solves the problems.

Since its written in Python its not well suited for solving real optimization problems, for that use Gurobi or CPLEX. If you don't want to pay GLPK.
